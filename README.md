When building iOS before creating build we need to execute commandd to update Pod.

```
cd ios
pod repo update
```

#### Android build commands

To prepare build execute followig command for Dev environment in debug mode.

```
flutter build apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart --debug
```

To prepare build execuute followig command for Dev environment in release mode.

```
flutter build apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart --release
```

To prepare build execute followig command for Prod environment in debug mode.

```
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --debug
```

To prepare build execuute followig command for Prod environment in release mode.

```
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --release
```

#### iOS build commands

To prepare build execute followig command for Dev environment in debug mode.

```
flutter build ios --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart --debug
```

To prepare build execuute followig command for Dev environment in release mode.

```
flutter build ios --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart --release
```

To prepare build execute followig command for Prod environment in debug mode.

```
flutter build ios --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --debug
```

To prepare build execuute followig command for Prod environment in release mode.

```
flutter build ios --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --release
```

#### Running build on device via command

The same principle as creating build, we use command run to start application on device.

For example:

```
flutter run apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart --debug

flutter run ios --flavor prod -t lib/main_dev.dart --debug
```

### Running app using Android Studio

**Step 1:**

First you need to configure Android Studio configuration for Dev i Prod targets. This is local setup for every developer.

![Dev Debug Configuration](dev_debug_configuration.png)
![Prod Release Configuration](prod_release_configuration.png)

**Step 2:**

Connect your device to machine or select desired simulator for selected configuration and hit run button!

## How to prepare builds for production

### iOS preparation

Before standard procedure of deploying iOS application to AppStore connect, execute followig command for Prod environment in release mode, after it continue as standard iOS application ipa release process via Xcode -> Archive.

```
flutter build ios --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --release
```

Warning: Do not execute clean command after executing build command.

After ipa file is uploaded & processed to AppStore connect. Prepare and upload dsyml file for Crashlytics usage. General instructions are:

```
Download appDsyms archive from App Store

1.1 Login: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com

1.2 Go to: MyApps -> Choose your app -> Test Flight -> Select app version that is in the App Store -> Build Metadata -> Includes Symbols (right side) -> Press: Download dSYM. Or go to Xcode -> Window -> Organizer -> Find Archive in Finder -> Right click Show Content -> Download dSYM folder

Open terminal, drag and drop 3 files on terminal on this order:

2.1 drag an drop: "upload-symbols" which can be found in /project/Pods/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols

2.2 write " -gsp "

2.3 drag an drop: "GoogleService-Info.plist" which can be found in /project/GoogleService-Info.plist

2.4 write " -p ios "

2.5 drag an drop: "appDsyms" folder which usually is in Download folder /Users/username/Downloads/appDsyms (folder not zip file)

2.6 Press Enter

In terminal the complete command should include -gsp and -p ios, full command looks like this: 2.1 -gsp 2.3 -p ios 2.5

Example:

/project/Pods/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp /project/GoogleService-Info.plist -p ios /Users/username/Downloads/appDsyms
```

### Android preparation

To prepare apk file for store, use the same command for building Prod environment in release mode .

```
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_production.dart --release
```

## CI/CD script - Examples

In project root there is .gitlab-ci.yml file containing examples of command to prepare and send builds in pipeline.
